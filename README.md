A linux server scripting API for [Sub Rosa](http://subrosagame.com/).

**âš  Early in development, APIs can change at any time.**

RosaServer uses LuaJIT/[moonjit](https://github.com/moonjit/moonjit); this means there's no hit to performance while being able to create anything from moderation tools to complex custom games with easy-to-write version agnostic code.

# Getting Started

## Installing

- Build the library or download the latest [Release](https://github.com/jpxs-intl/RosaServer/releases).
- Your directory should contain `libluajit.so`, `librosaserver.so`, `subrosadedicated.x64`, and the `data` folder (the last two can be found with your game install).
  - You will also need the `rosaserversatellite` binary if you plan to use the ChildProcess API. Make sure it has execute permissions.
- There's a 99% chance you'll also want to use [RosaServerCore](https://github.com/jpxs-intl/RosaServerCore).
- To run it, you'll need the following Ubuntu (or equivalent on your distro) packages: `lz4`, `libopus-dev`, `libsqlite3-dev`, OpenSSL (by default on most distros), and glibc from GCC 13.

## Running

```bash
LD_PRELOAD="$(pwd)/libluajit.so $(pwd)/librosaserver.so" ./subrosadedicated.x64
```

The server will start as normal and `main/init.lua` will be executed.

# Documentation

For complete reference on using the Lua API, go to the [wiki](https://github.com/jpxs-intl/RosaServer/wiki).

# Building

Make sure all submodules are cloned, and run `./build.sh`

## Required Packages
- `build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu
- `cmake`
- `libssl-dev`
- `libsqlite3-dev`
- `libopus-dev`
- `liblz4-dev`

Here's a basic script I use to copy the required files after they're compiled. For example, `./build.sh && ./postbuild.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

DEST=../RosaServerCore/

cp ./moonjit/src/libluajit.so "$DEST"
cp ./release/RosaServer/librosaserver.so "$DEST"
cp ./release/RosaServerSatellite/rosaserversatellite "$DEST"
```
